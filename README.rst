Description
-----------

Python replacements for functions that are part of the IDL_ built-in library, or
part of astronomical IDL libraries.  The emphasis is on reproducing results of
the astronomical library functions.  Only the bare minimum of IDL_ built-in
functions are implemented to support this.

There are three astronomical IDL libraries targeted:

* idlutils_
* `Goddard utilities`_ (which are distributed with idlutils)
* idlspec2d_

The current goal is to get this package affiliated with the astropy_ project.
